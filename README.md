# Angular Assignment

## Description

This application was made in preparation of an interview. The assignment:

> Create a small angular application using angular 16. The application should
> have 2 forms. The first form should allow you to create a client with
> fields like Name, Surname, email and address (street name, post code, house
> number and city). The second form should allow you to view the list of all
> clients and view the details of a selected client. You are allowed to use
> any libraries you like. You do not have to spend too much time on the
> assignment but write the code like you would write it for production.
> Please also let us know how many hours you spent working on this. You can
> send us the github link, or Google or One Drive link for a zip file without
> node_modules folder.
