// By using this Angular-specific `:host` selector, it selects this specific component as a whole.
// It does not apply to anything further within this component, just the root.
:host {
  padding: 20px;
}

// After that, you can just use css selectors like normally.
:host.some-class {
  padding: 100px;
}
